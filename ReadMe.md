Sketch Plugins
==============

I was struggling to do few simple stuffs in Sketch, looking out for some plugins for them.
I didn't find any for doing these simple things, so I ended up writing my own. After all,
writing Sketch plugins is fun!

#### ToCamelCase
Simple plugin to convert your text layer(s) from any case to camelcase.

Example- 

`hello boys` => `Hello Boys`
`ROSALINE` => `Rosaline`

#### RenameWithPrefix
Another simple plugin. Often you end up with files that you use for icons/assets but the names
are just not prefixed with proper text for you to identify them later or when your developer 
uses them. This will enable you to rename layer(s) with any prefix you want. Layers with applied prefix
won't be modified upon applying same prefix again.

Example-

`shape04` => `icon-shape04`
`person` => `asset-icon-person`
